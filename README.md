## About

This library is what powers the [ramsey/devtools](https://github.com/ramsey/devtools)
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org) plugin. Since you can't extend Composer
plugins, this exists to allow for extension. If you don't need to extend this
for your own plugin needs, and you want the functionality provided by the plugin,
check out [ramsey/devtools](https://github.com/ramsey/devtools) instead.

This package also provides the `devtools` CLI tool, which you may use even if
you do not want to use the plugin functionality.

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project and its community, you are expected to
uphold this code.

## Installation

Install this package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
composer require --dev ramsey/devtools-lib
```

## Usage

If using this library as a standalone tool, and not as a Composer plugin, type
`./vendor/bin/devtools list` to see the list of commands this library provides.

``` bash
./vendor/bin/devtools list
```

> Install [ramsey/devtools](https://github.com/ramsey/devtools), instead, if you
> do not need to extend this library to create your own Composer plugin.

### Extending or Overriding ramsey/devtools-lib Commands

Maybe the commands ramsey/devtools-lib provides don't do everything you need, or
maybe you want to replace them entirely. The configuration allows you to do
this!

Using the `ramsey/devtools.commands` property in the `extra` section of
`composer.json`, you may specify any command (*without* your custom prefix, if
you've configured one) as having other scripts to run, in addition to the
command's default behavior, or you may override the default behavior entirely.

Specifying additional scripts works exactly like
[writing custom commands](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#writing-custom-commands)
in `composer.json`, but the location is different. Everything you can do with
a custom Composer command, you can do here because they're the same thing.

``` json
{
    "extra": {
        "ramsey/devtools": {
            "command-prefix": "my-prefix",
            "commands": {
                "lint": {
                    "script": "@mylint"
                },
                "test:all": {
                    "script": [
                        "@mylint",
                        "@phpbench"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "scripts": {
        "mylint": "parallel-lint src tests",
        "phpbench": "phpbench run"
    }
}
```

In this way, when you run `./vendor/bin/devtools lint` or
`./vendor/bin/devtools test:all`, it will execute the default behavior first and
then run your additional commands. To override the default behavior so that it
doesn't run at all and only your scripts run, specify the `override` property
and set it to `true`.

``` json
{
    "extra": {
        "ramsey/devtools": {
            "commands": {
                "lint": {
                    "override": true,
                    "script": "parallel-lint src tests"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Before contributing to this project, familiarize
yourself with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

To develop this project, you will need [PHP](https://www.php.net) 7.4 or greater
and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

After cloning this repository locally, execute the following commands:

``` bash
cd /path/to/repository
composer install
```

Now, you are ready to develop!

### Tooling

This project uses [CaptainHook](https://github.com/CaptainHookPhp/captainhook)
to validate all staged changes prior to commit.

#### Commands

To see all the commands available for contributing to this project:

``` bash
composer devtools
```

#### Coding Standards

This project follows a superset of [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)
coding standards, enforced by [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).
The project PHP_CodeSniffer configuration may be found in `phpcs.xml.dist`.

CaptainHook will run PHP_CodeSniffer before committing. It will attempt to fix
any errors it can, and it will reject the commit if there are any un-fixable
issues. Many issues can be fixed automatically and will be done so pre-commit.

You may lint the entire codebase using PHP_CodeSniffer with the following
commands:

``` bash
# Lint
composer devtools lint

# Lint and autofix
composer devtools lint:fix
```

#### Static Analysis

This project uses a combination of [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)
and [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm) to provide static analysis of PHP
code. Configurations for these are in `phpstan.neon.dist` and `psalm.xml`,
respectively.

CaptainHook will run PHPStan and Psalm before committing. The pre-commit hook
does not attempt to fix any static analysis errors. Instead, the commit will
fail, and you must fix the errors manually.

You may run static analysis manually across the whole codebase with the
following command:

``` bash
# Static analysis
composer devtools analyze
```

#### Project Structure

This project uses [pds/skeleton](https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton) as its
base folder structure and layout.
